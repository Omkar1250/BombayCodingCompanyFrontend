            </h1>
            <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-5 lg:w-[95%]">
            Bombay Coding Company was born out of a passion for technology and innovation. In 2022, a group of friends and tech enthusiasts, all sharing a common dream of transforming the digital landscape, came together in the vibrant city of Mumbai. Our journey began in a small co-working space, where late-night brainstorming sessions and relentless coding marathons laid the foundation for what we are today.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-5 lg:w-[95%]">
            From those humble beginnings, we have grown into a dynamic team of talented developers, designers, and strategists. Our commitment to excellence and our unyielding drive to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible have been the driving forces behind our success. Today, Bombay Coding Company stands as a testament to the power of collaboration, creativity, and a relentless pursuit of innovation.
